Hi! The goal is to demonstrate, how AI generated designs can be easily converted into 3D objects and rendered.

Therefore we have prepared 5 tshirts and will show you the process.

Have fun! :)

Still some stuff to do, but we can easily automate it now in our platform.

Hope you got, what we wanted to show :)

Used commands
blender -b models/shirt_new.blend --python change-image.py --render-output '/Users/manzked/workspaces/yoona/blender-automation/samples/output/shirt05-render-##.png' --render-frame 1 -- -f '/Users/manzked/workspaces/yoona/blender-automation/samples/input/shirt05.png'
